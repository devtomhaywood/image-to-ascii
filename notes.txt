Image is a collection of pixels that have a height and width. 

Each pixel is a part of the RGB colour spectrum, thus I can detect how light or dark each pixel is.

To generate ascii art from an image, I imagine I would need to check each pixel and depending on its brightness map it to a character.

Perhaps convert to greyscale. Makes it much easier to accomdate.
